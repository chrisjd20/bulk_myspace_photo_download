# bulk_myspace_photo_download
This is a tampermonkey tamper monkey script that allows you to download all files from an individual mix on myspace all at once. I logged into my myspace after a super long time and saw all my old photos so I went in and saw there was no super fast way to download all the high res photos at once so I made this.

# Installation:

1. Download And Install TamperMonkey Chrome Extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

2. Copy the 

# How To Use:

1. Copy the source myspace_bulk_image_downloader.js and paste it into tampermonkey when you create a new script

Heres a video on how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpjvLpyiras

2. Then login to myspace and go to your "Mixes" tab on the toolbar on the left of your screen.

3. Select one of your photo "Mixes" or albums.

4. The script will detect that you are on a valid Mix page. Then it will attempt to load all of you images by scrolling right.

THIS MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO LOAD DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PICS YOU HAVE.

5. Once finished, a big red button with text will pop up on the top left hand side of your screen. Right click and open new tab. 

6. Then right click on the page (not on an image) and click on "Save As...".

This will save all your pictures to disk under a folder based upon what name you typed it. 

Voila, Done!
